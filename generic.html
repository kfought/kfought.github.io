								<h2>I Never Knew!</h2>
								<p>
									Welcome to Embark. I'm Kaitlyn, a senior at Virginia Tech.
								During my freshman year of college, one of my classes connected
									with Christiansburg Middle School, a public school less than 10 miles away,
									to tutor students. I never knew until this experience the difficulties that
									large groups of kids face as they grow up in the United States' public school system.
								</p>
								<p>
									It turns out that socioeconomic status, and even more importantly, the stability of the home life,
									really affects students. Much more than we truly realize. Many of us enjoyed
									a stable, relatively happy childhood growing up, and had parents who made us
									do our homework. It can be hard to understand these students if you grew up that way.
									It was hard for me at first. It's easy to judge.
								</p>
								<p>
									It's my hope that you'll join me for a while and hear my story. Check out the Blog Posts (insert link)
									where I recount my personal experience tutoring at CMS, interview my supervisor from the school,
									and more. Check out Podcast and Video to find work I've made with a group
									of other VT students in which we look at Teach for America.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks again for stopping by! I hope you learn as much as I have!
